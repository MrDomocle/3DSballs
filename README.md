# 3DSballs

The 3DS is now officially the best place to play with balls!  

## Features
- **Physics**: balls collide with screen edges and each other (very inefficiently)  
- **Simulation controls**: you can change gravity or (n3DS only) bounciness  
- **Screen tearing!!**: It's kinda slow rn so after ~20 balls you're gonna see a screen tear in the middle  

### Controls
- **Touchscreen**: Spawn a ball  
- **Circle Pad or Tilt**: Change gravity  
- **A + B**: Clear all balls  
- **B**: Erase one ball  
- **X**: Spawn 4 balls  
- **C-Stick (n3DS only)**: Change ball bounciness
